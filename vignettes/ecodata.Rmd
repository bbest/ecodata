[`ecodata`](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata) is an R package developed to hold and facilitate interaction with ecosystem indicators on the Northeast Conitnental Shelf. These indicators are applied to State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reports. These yearly reports are developed by the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center for distribution to the US Fisheries Management Councils(FMCs). 

Visualizations of ecosystem indicators can be found at the links below.

### Using this package

Use the command remotes::install_github("noaa-edab/ecodata",build_vignettes=TRUE) to install the package.

#### load required packages

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ecodata)
```

## Loading data sets

1.  All derived data sets are available once the package has been loaded
    into the environment. View available data sets using the syntax
    `ecodata::...`

## Using geom\_gls()

Also included in this package is a “geom” extension of `ggplot2` for
assessing trends in time series. This function fits four trend models to
each series, uses AICc to select the best model fit, and then implements
a likelihood-ratio test to determine if a trend is present. If a
significant trend is present (*P* \< 0.05), then the trend line is
plotted with the series. By default, a purple line color is assigned to
negative trends and orange to positive trends. More detailed information
about this method is available
[here](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/trend-analysis.html).

`geom_gls()` follows the same rules as other `ggplot` stats/geoms. For
example,

    m <- 0.1
    x <- 1:30
    y <-  m*x + rnorm(30, sd = 0.35)
    
    data <- data.frame(x = x,
                      y = y)
    
    #Plot series with trend 
    ggplot2::ggplot(data = data,aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_gls()

produces
